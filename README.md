# sequelizedBurger

### This 'restaurant app' allows you to make and eat delicious virtual burgers, using mySQL, node.js, and express.js.  

*This is a continuation of [this](https://github.com/amcosta9/burger) repo, configured to use Sequelize to make the mySQL queries.*

#### How to Install and Run the Application

1. Install the app by cloning this repo and navigating to the file in the command line.
2. Remember to `npm install` so the dependencies are loaded to your local copy of the app.
3. Create a database using MySQL called __burgers_db__.  Use the code in the `seeds.sql` and `schema.sql` files to populate your __burgers__ database with a table and some burgers. (Use Workbench or MySQL in the command line).
4. Run the application by typing `node server.js` in the command line.
5. Navigate to: `localhost:5432/` in the browser to check out the app.  


**_Alternatively, this app is live [here](https://lit-coast-42984.herokuapp.com/) _**
